### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **super-efficient autonomous flying robot** capable of long-endurance surveillance missions. By mimicking the flight mechanics of large birds (such as eagles or albatrosses), the robot utilizes a combination of gliding and flapping to maximize energy efficiency.

### Key Technologies

To achieve ultra-high efficiency and extended flight times, this research integrates two core technologies:

1. **Structural Battery Technology:**
    * Unlike traditional drones where batteries are dead weight, this project utilizes **structural batteries** that function as both the power source and the load-bearing structure (fuselage and wings).
    * This integration significantly improves energy density and reduces overall weight.

2. **Biomimetic Flight Control:**
    * **Learning-based Control:** We utilize Reinforcement Learning (specifically PPO) to train flight policies that adapt to changing wind conditions.
    * **Soaring Strategies:** The control algorithm is designed to exploit thermal updrafts and wind gradients, allowing the robot to glide for extended periods without consuming battery power, similar to how birds fly.

### Research Goals

* Design and fabrication of a prototype using structural battery composite materials.
* Development of a navigation algorithm for autonomous thermal soaring.
* Demonstration of stable locomotion and surveillance capabilities in outdoor environments.
