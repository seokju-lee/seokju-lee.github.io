This is a sample project page created to show how a project entry should look.

## How to add a new project

1. Create a new file under `_projects/` named `NN_project-name.markdown`.
2. Include front-matter fields: `title`, `date`, `img` (or `thumbnail`), `tags`, `summary`.
3. Put images under `assets/img/projects/<projectname>/` and reference them in `img`.
4. The project card on the main page will automatically pick up `tags` and show the project in that category slider.

Example front-matter:

```
