  title={Legged Robot State Estimation Using Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter with a Neural Compensator},
  author={Lee, Seokju and Kim, Hyun-Bin and Kim, Kyung-Soo},
  abstract={This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches},

  title={Text Optimization with Latent Inversion for Non-Rigid Editing},
  author={Jung, Yunji and Lee, Seokju and Djanibekov, Tair and Ye, Jong Chul and Shim, Hyunjung},
  abstract={Text-guided non-rigid editing involves complex edits for input images, such as changing motion or compositions within their surroundings. Since it requires manipulating the input structure, existing methods often struggle with preserving object identity and background, particularly when combined with Stable Diffusion. In this work, we propose a new approach for non-rigid editing with Stable Diffusion, aimed at improving the identity preservation quality without compromising editability. Our approach comprises three stages: text optimization, latent inversion, and timestep-aware text injection sampling. Inspired by the success of Imagic, we employ their text optimization for smooth editing. Then, we introduce latent inversion to preserve the input image's identity without additional model fine-tuning. To fully utilize the input reconstruction ability of latent inversion, we suggest timestep-aware text injection sampling. This effectively retains the structure of the input image by injecting the source text prompt in early sampling steps and then transitioning to the target prompt in subsequent sampling steps. This strategic approach seamlessly harmonizes with text optimization, facilitating complex non-rigid edits to the input without losing the original identity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of identity preservation, editability, and aesthetic quality through extensive experiments.},

  title={Temperature Compensation Method for a Six-Axis Force/Torque Sensor Using a Gated Recurrent Unit},
  author={Kim, Hyun-Bin and Lee, Seokju and Ham, Byeong-Il and Choi, Keun-Ha and Kim, Kyung-Soo},
  abstract={This study aims to enhance the accuracy of a six-axis force/torque sensor compared to existing approaches that utilize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Least Square Method. The sensor used in this study is based on a photo-coupler and operates with infrared light, making it susceptible to dark current effects, which cause drift due to temperature variations. Additionally, the sensor is compact and lightweight (45g), resulting in a low thermal capacity. Consequently, even small amounts of heat can induce rapid temperature changes, affecting the sensor's performance in real time. To address these challenges, this study compares the conventional MLP approach with the proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based method. Experimental results demonstrate that the GRU approach, leveraging sequential data, achieves superior performance.},

  title={Learning legged mobile manipulation using reinforcement learning},
  author={Lee, Seokju and Jeon, Seunghun and Hwangbo, Jemin},
  abstract={Many studies on quadrupedal manipulators have been conducted for extending the workspace of the end-effector. Many of these studies, especially the recent ones, use model-based control for the arm and learning-based control for the leg. Some studies solely focused on model-based control for controlling both the base and arm. However, model-based controllers such as MPC can be computationally inefficient when there are many contacts between the end-effector and the object. The dynamics of the interactions between a quadrupedal manipulator and the object in contact are complex and often unpredictable without high-resolution contact sensors on the end-effector. In this study, we investigate the possibility of using a reinforcement learning strategy to control an end-effector of a legged mobile manipulator. The proposed framework is verified for a walking and tracking task of the end-effector in a simulation environment.},
